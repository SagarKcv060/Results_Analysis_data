Results Analysis Data Exploration
The Total 8 results datasets of Engg Students from semester I to VIII.
We need to explore the Results Data through the following questions,
I have created a total of 16 Query questions to extract the results data
1. show the Top 12 students from semester IV having SGPA > 12
2. Top 10 Students by Row Number, rank and dense rank functions
3. Show the SGPA of all Regular students from semester I to VIII and also CGPA.
4. Show the CGPA in terms of Percentage of all the Regular students from sem I to VIII
5. Show the SGPA of all Lateral Entry students from semester III to VIII and also CGPA.
6. Show the CGPA in terms of Percentage of all the Lateral entry students from sem III to VIII
7. Create View of all the students showing Percentage 
8. how the results of Lateral entry students from sem III 
9. As Mathematical subjects (M_I, M_II, P&S) have more impact on Engg Students,
-- Check the SGPA of all the studnets in sem III having SGPA > 9 and Probability and Statistics got 'O' grade   
10. Check the SGPA of all the studnets in sem III having Probability and Statistics got 'F' grade   
11. As the Strength of Materials I subjects is basic fundamental subject
 -- check the No. of failed students in SM_I in sem III.
12. Show the Top 10 students with 'A+' or 'O' grade in FM, SM_I
13. Count the no. of failed students in OCF&HM.
14. -- Create a Case statement showing difference of Two semesters SGPA 
-- if difference of Two semesters SGPA > 0.5 then 'Performace Increased' 
-- if difference of Two semesters SGPA < 0 then 'Performace Decreased' 
15. Use Window functions for Ranking the Top 10 CGPA Performance students
16. FM, OCF&HM are the Important subjects from sem III and IV
-- Show the performance studnets based on these two subjects.


Any Suggestions on the above Queries, Welcome!!
